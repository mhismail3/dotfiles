# AI Collaboration Rules

## Preparation
- Read `AGENTS.md` (history + rationale) and `README.md` before editing.
- Plan edits and identify which files you expect to touch.

## Working guidelines
- Keep changes scoped, reversible, and idempotent; avoid hardcoded paths when environment variables or configuration can be used.
- Update `AGENTS.md` with dated, reverse-chronological notes (what/why) when behavior changes; update `README.md` for user-facing changes.
- Use conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`) unless instructed otherwise.
- Avoid destructive commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`, deleting user data) without explicit approval.

## Quality checks
- Run quick, relevant checks for touched file types (e.g., syntax/lint/tests) when available.
- Communicate assumptions, risks, and follow-ups after completing tasks.
